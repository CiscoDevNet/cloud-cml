# This is an unsupported workaround for the lack of the VMX CPU flag support on
# AWS.
#
# It will disable the check for the VMX CPU flag -- when this patch is in place,
# the system will always report the VMX flag to be present.
#
# Some platforms like Linux, IOSv and IOSv-L2 will still work but others will
# not and crash!
